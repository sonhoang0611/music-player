…alance the impact work vs technical work well, soon you no longer be seen as the technical guy doing technical stuff. People will start to appreciate your work’s timeliness and realize the actual business value you’re bringing to them. When you see your work from a business value perspective, you are no longer the technical guy talking technical stuff (while business users yawn left and right in the background). When you think and talk like a business user, you no longer sound like a data service provider — you actively participate in the business conversation and converse like one. You became an equal business partner. And if you operate at this level long enough, people start to see you as a decision scientist, a thought partner, or an internal data-driven “management consultant” — one that helps them improve decision quality, and they’ll seek you out where the numbers speak. And I think that’s where every good data analyst should strive to become.
